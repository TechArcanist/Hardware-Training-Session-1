- Search for **ESP32** in the search bar.
- Install the package labeled **"esp32 by Espressif Systems"**.

## 3. Connect the ESP32 to Your PC
- Use a **micro USB cable** to connect the ESP32 to your computer.
- Open the **Device Manager** (on Windows) and check for a new port under **Ports (COM & LPT)**.
  - If no new port is visible:
    - Unplug and reconnect the cable.
    - Ensure you are using a **data cable** (some cables are power-only).
  - If you see a yellow triangle next to the port, proceed to the next step.

## 4. Install the CP2102 Driver (if needed)
- If the ESP32 doesnâ€™t appear in the Device Manager or shows a yellow triangle error, install the **CP2102 driver**:
  - Download the driver from the official [CP2102 driver page](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).
  - Extract the downloaded file.
  - In the Device Manager, right-click the port with the yellow triangle.
  - Select **Update Driver** > **Browse My Computer for Drivers**.
  - Navigate to the extracted driver folder and click **OK**.
- After installation, the yellow triangle should disappear, and the ESP32 will be recognized properly.
